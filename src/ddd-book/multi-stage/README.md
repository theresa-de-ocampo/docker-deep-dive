# Multi-stage builds

This example is based on the [Docker sample buildme repo])(https://github.com/dockersamples/buildme) and contains a simple client server app written on Go.

## App code

The app code is in the `cmd` directory but you don't need to interact with the app code or be a Go programmer.
